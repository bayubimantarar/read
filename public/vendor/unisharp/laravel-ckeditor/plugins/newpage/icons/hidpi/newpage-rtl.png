 *
 * Generate a customized focus state and for any input with the specified color,
 * which defaults to the `$input-focus-border-color` variable.
 *
 * We highly encourage you to not customize the default value, but instead use
 * this to tweak colors on an as-needed basis. This aesthetic change is based on
 * WebKit's default styles, but applicable to a wider range of browsers. Its
 * usability and accessibility should be taken into account with any change.
